# Numpy_Pandas
I am taking a course on how to maser Numpy and Pandas libraries.
Project #1
The first project is a numpy project that plays with some facts about extroverts and intoverts using just Numpy, I coded that mostly along with the Udemy course, and enjoyed the amazing teaching style of Rune T.
I will upload the survey and its results so that everyone can use!
