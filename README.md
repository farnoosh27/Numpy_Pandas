# Numpy_Pandas
I am taking a course on how to maser Numpy and Pandas libraries.

## Project # 1

The first project is a numpy project that plays with some facts about extroverts and intoverts using just Numpy, I coded that mostly along with the Udemy course, and enjoyed the amazing teaching style of Rune T.

I will upload the survey and its results so that everyone can use!


## Project # 2

This project explores three different files. 

2.1 "gdp_world_data.csv" --> has some information on the gdp growth of many world countries over a period.

2.2 "naturalearth_lowres" --> is a dataset in GeoPandas and has some graphical info on continents, countries, and populations

2.3 "min_wages.csv" --> has some information on the minimum wage in different countires and how many hours people work
